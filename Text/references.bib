Commonly, PA is performed on the basis of the variables{\rq} product-moment correlation matrix. To improve dimensionality assessments for dichotomous or ordered categorical variables, it has been proposed to replace product-moment correlations with more appropriate coefficients, such as tetrachoric or polychoric correlations. While similar modifications have proven useful for various factor analytic approaches, PA results were not consistently improved. The present article outlines a main reason for this result. Specifically, it explains the dependency of PA results on differing proportions of category probabilities when using tetrachoric or polychoric correlations and shows how to adjust for it by generating appropriate reference eigenvalues. The accuracy of dimensionality assessments of PA accounting for category probability proportions versus not accounting for them is investigated using simulation studies. The results show that the category probability adjusted approach distinctly improves dimensionality assessments.

A full maximum likelihood approach and a partition maximum likelihood approach are used to attain the first stage estimates of the thresholds and the underlying covariance or correlation matrix. Then based on the joint asymptotic distributions of the first stage estimators and appropriate weight matrices, the generalized least squares approach is employed to estimate the structures parameters in the covariance or the correlation structures. Asymptotic properties of the estimates are derived. A simulation study is reported to give some ideas about the accuracy and the asymptotic behaviors of the method.},

Two new Bayesian estimates, maximum a posteriori (MAP) and expected a posteriori (EAP), are compared to ML, the classic solution, to estimate PCC. Different types of prior distributions are used to investigate the sensitivity of a prior distribution onto the Bayesian PCC estimation. In this simulation study, it appears that the MAP would be the estimator of choice for the PCC. The performance of the MAP is not only better than the ML but also appears to overcome the limitations of the EAP (i.e., the shrinkage effect).},

@article{forero2009,
	abstract = { Factor analysis models with ordinal indicators are often estimated using a 3-stage procedure where the last stage involves obtaining parameter estimates by least squares from the sample polychoric correlations. A simulation study involving 324 conditions (1,000 replications per condition) was performed to compare the performance of diagonally weighted least squares (DWLS) and unweighted least squares (ULS) in the procedure's third stage. Overall, both methods provided accurate and similar results. However, ULS was found to provide more accurate and less variable parameter estimates, as well as more precise standard errors and better coverage rates. Nevertheless, convergence rates for DWLS are higher. Our recommendation is therefore to use ULS, and, in the case of nonconvergence, to use DWLS, as this method might converge when ULS does not. },

@article{dewinter2012,
	abstract = { Principal axis factoring (PAF) and maximum likelihood factor analysis (MLFA) are two of the most popular estimation methods in exploratory factor analysis. It is known that PAF is better able to recover weak factors and that the maximum likelihood estimator is asymptotically efficient. However, there is almost no evidence regarding which method should be preferred for different types of factor patterns and sample sizes. Simulations were conducted to investigate factor recovery by PAF and MLFA for distortions of ideal simple structure and sample sizes between 25 and 5000. Results showed that PAF is preferred for population solutions with few indicators per factor and for overextraction. MLFA outperformed PAF in cases of unequal loadings within factors and for underextraction. It was further shown that PAF and MLFA do not always converge with increasing sample size. The simulation findings were confirmed by an empirical study as well as by a classic plasmode, Thurstone's box problem. The present results are of practical value for factor analysts. },

	abstract = {The analysis of polychoric correlations via principal component analysis and exploratory factor analysis are well-known approaches to determine the dimensionality of ordered categorical items. However, the application of these approaches has been considered as critical due to the possible indefiniteness of the polychoric correlation matrix. A possible solution to this problem is the application of smoothing algorithms. This study compared the effects of three smoothing algorithms, based on the Frobenius norm, the adaption of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors, and on minimum-trace factor analysis, on the accuracy of various variations of parallel analysis by the means of a simulation study. We simulated different datasets which varied with respect to the size of the respondent sample, the size of the item set, the underlying factor model, the skewness of the response distributions and the number of response categories in each item. We found that a parallel analysis and principal component analysis of smoothed polychoric and Pearson correlations led to the most accurate results in detecting the number of major factors in simulated datasets when compared to the other methods we investigated. Of the methods used for smoothing polychoric correlation matrices, we recommend the algorithm based on minimum trace factor analysis.},

We extend earlier work on this question by examining these phenomena in the situation in which the common factor model does not hold exactly in the population. We present a theoretical framework for representing such lack of fit and examine its implications in the population and sample. Based on this approach we hypothesize that lack of fit of the model in the population will not, on the average. influence recovery of population factors in analysis of sample data, regardless of degree of model error and regardless of sample size. Rather. such recovery will be affected only by phenomena related to sampling error which have been studied previously. These hypotheses are investigated and verified in two sampling studies, one using artificial data and one using empirical data.},

When applied to several {\lq}school problems{\rq} such as Thurstone{\rq}s box problem, it yields results which appear to be closer to graphical solutions than those yielded by other analytical approaches. The complete evaluation of this and other methods awaits the development of parallel highspeed computational systems and their application to a wide variety of data{\ldots} . The principle utilized by the quartimin criterion could be applied easily to the special case where one requires orthogonality. This has not yet been done; at any rate, it would seem that the criterion of simple structure should alone determine to what extent any given set of data approaches orthogonality. Like other oblique solutions, the biquartimin criterion allows complete freedom in this respect.'' (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)},

	abstractnote = {A simple and very general algorithm for oblique rotation is identified. While motivated by the rotation problem in factor analysis, it may be used to minimize almost any function of a not necessarily square matrix whose columns are restricted to have unit length. The algorithm has two steps. The first is to compute the gradient of the rotation criterion and the second is to project this onto a manifold of matrices with unit length columns. For this reason it is called a gradient projection algorithm. Because the projection step is very simple, implementation of the algorithm involves little more than computing the gradient of the rotation criterion which for many applications is very simple. It is proven that the algorithm is strictly monotone, that is as long as it is not already at a stationary point, each step will decrease the value of the criterion. Examples from a variety of areas are used to demonstrate the algorithm, including oblimin rotation, target rotation, simplimax rotation, and rotation to similarity and simplicity simultaneously. While it may be, the algorithm is not intended for use as a standard algorithm for well established problems, but rather as a tool for investigating new methods where its generality and simplicity may save an investigator substantial effort.},
