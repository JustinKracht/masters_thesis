Talked with Allie about the results from her simulations. She looked at indefinite matrices obtained by computing correlation matrices from datasets with ~25% missing (MCAR) data and compared factor loading recovery with PAF across the three smoothing algorithms (APA, BY, KB) and no smoothing. She found there were no practically significant results. In my simulation, I'll be looking at indefinite matrices obtained form tetrachorics --- is there a reason to expect any difference? Need to check how population correlation matrix recovery for each of the smoothing algorithms compare to one another and how this might relate to factor loading recovery. Allie also found that BY leads to fewer Heywood cases than APA and KB. Would it make sense to compare factor loading recovery (RMSE, bias, variance) for only variables corresponding to Heywood cases? Allie suggested also checking congruence coefficients.
